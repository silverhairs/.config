# Ghostty Configuration
# Migrated from Kitty configuration

# Fonts
font-family = "IBM Plex Mono"
font-size = 14

# Font features for Nerd Fonts
# Ghostty has built-in Nerd Fonts support, no symbol_map needed

# Background
# background-opacity = 0.85
# background-blur-radius = 65

# Note: Background images are not supported in Ghostty
# background_image, background_image_layout, background_image_linear, background_tint
# are Kitty-specific features

# Mouse
mouse-hide-while-typing = true

# Window
window-padding-x = 4
window-padding-y = 4
# window-decoration = true

# macOS specific
macos-titlebar-style = hidden
macos-custom-icon = "~/.config/ghostty/Ghostty.icns"

# Tabs
# Note: Ghostty's tab bar is different from Kitty's powerline style
# tab-bar-style and tab_title_max_length are not directly configurable
# Ghostty uses a native tab bar on macOS

# Cursor
cursor-style = bar
cursor-style-blink = false
# Note: cursor_beam_thickness, cursor_trail, and cursor_trail_decay 
# are not available in Ghostty

# Performance
# Note: input_delay and repaint_delay are handled automatically in Ghostty

# Audio/Visual feedback
# Note: enabled_audio_bell and bell_on_tab are not configurable in Ghostty
# Ghostty uses system bell settings

# Window borders
# Note: draw_minimal_borders and window_border_width are not configurable
# Ghostty handles this automatically

# Notifications
# Note: notify_on_cmd_finish is not available in Ghostty

# Keybindings
# Alt+Left: word backward
keybind = alt+left=text:\x1b\x62
# Alt+Right: word forward
keybind = alt+right=text:\x1b\x66

# Navigate between panes (Kitty-style)
keybind = ctrl+shift+left_bracket=goto_split:previous
keybind = ctrl+shift+right_bracket=goto_split:next

# Note: kitty_mod+/ search binding not directly portable
# Ghostty has its own search with cmd+f (macOS) or ctrl+shift+f (Linux)

# Theme - Gruvbox Dark Hard
# You'll need to set this in Ghostty's theme system
# Create themes in: ~/.config/ghostty/themes/
theme = gruvbox-dark-hard

# Note: Ghostty doesn't use "include" for themes like Kitty
# Instead, you define themes in separate files or use built-in themes
