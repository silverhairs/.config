# .config

Still a couple of configs missing, will add them soon, as well as a script to set this up quickly

## Getting Started
```sh
$ make install
```
This command will install the packages below in your system:
- [x] [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
- [x] [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)
- [x] [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd)

- [x] [raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)
- [x] [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

Note that by default, Homebrew will be used as a package manager, unless a package is not hosted on homebrew, the `install` command will install it from homebrew.

## Requirements:
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
