name: twg
description: >
  Use TWG whenever Atlassian or company context would help:
  Jira workitems and issues; Confluence pages and PRDs; Bitbucket PRs;
  project or goal status and launch readiness; owners, SMEs,
  approvers, or escalation; personal, org, or leadership work rollups and out-of-office
  catch-ups; dependency maps; code search, repository, or PR discovery; incidents,
  on-call, or reliability; sharing HTML, CSV, PDF, or presentation files
  with coworkers;
  and deep internal research across connected sources, docs, work, and people.

Companions: `twg skills list`.

## TWG Terms

- **Anchor**: the key, URL, person, project, repository, or window that a
  request starts from. Anchor read-only answers on it.
- **Hydrate**: get the full record of a search or query result.

## Fast path for common simple commands

| Need | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Find sources about a topic | `twg rovo search "<topic>" --limit 10` |
| Read a Confluence page | `twg confluence content get <id-or-url> --detail full --format md` |
| Read a Jira workitem | `twg jira workitem get <KEY>` |
| Check what code does | `twg search-code search "<q>"` |
| Read a code file | `twg search-code file <path> --workspace <workspace> --repo <repo>` |

Add `--site <site>` when supplied. Read at most 3 Confluence IDs per call.
Use `--search-mode lexical` to search code for an exact string or identifier.
Some answers depend on how a system behaves, such as a default, limit, validation rule, error or config value.
For these, check the code with `search-code` before you rely on docs, then read the file that sets it.

Read search results before you cite them.
For questions these commands cover, do not run `twg help-map` or `twg help describe "<command>"`.
Run independent reads in one shell call, separated by `;`.

For other tasks or unclear syntax, follow **Plan First**.

## Plan First

1. Run `twg help-map`; `*` marks writes. Do not pipe it through `head`.
2. Describe the selected commands in one call (up to 10):
   `twg help describe "<a>" "<b>"`. Reuse those contracts.
3. After contract review, plan internally between `### Plan` and `### End plan`.
   Give one step per call: exact command paths, inputs, flags, dependencies, and unknowns linked to their producer steps.
   Append the plan after all commands in the first execution shell call, with `#` before each line.
   Print only on user request or for clarification or approval.
4. Batch independent reads, separated by `;` (`&&` for dependencies).
   Pipe JSON to `jq` only with `set -o pipefail`; check error fields.

If a command is unclear, run `twg help <terms>`. For more guidance, run
`twg help discover-skills "<intent>"`, then follow `next.loadReference` or
`next.loadSkill`.

## Overview

Load the narrowest companion skill:

- Product work: `../twg-jira/SKILL.md`, `../twg-confluence/SKILL.md`, or
  `../twg-space-creation/SKILL.md`.
- Status: `../twg-status-rollups/SKILL.md`. Load it before engineering.
- Relationships: `../twg-context-discovery/SKILL.md`.
- People: `references/USER-IDENTIFIERS.md`.
- Research: `../twg-agentic-search/SKILL.md`.
- Ownership: `../twg-responsibility-routing/SKILL.md`.
- Code and PRs: `../twg-engineering-work/SKILL.md`.
- Stale work: `../twg-jira-resolve-merged-work/SKILL.md`.
- Incidents: `../twg-operational-health/SKILL.md`.
- Only if the user explicitly invokes `twg-code-review`: `../twg-code-review/SKILL.md`.
- Artifacts: `../twg-artifacts/SKILL.md` for prior Artifact IDs, or to share or update one.


## Invocation And Output

Run `twg <command>`. On shell `command not found`, use `$HOME/.local/bin/twg`
(macOS/Linux) / `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\twg\bin\twg.exe` (PowerShell), then
tell user to add that directory to PATH. Do not treat auth or command errors as
PATH failures.

Do not add per-command env prefixes unless requested; hosts may set `TWG_AGENT_DEFAULTS=1`.

- Answer from inline or already-read compact output if it supports the
  requested facts.
- Quote extracted facts with their sources, not whole payloads.
- For gaps, follow `references/OUTPUT.md`. Keep unavailable evidence unknown.
- On a restricted host, use only `twg` and permitted output files, not
  arbitrary host files, credentials, or other agent runs.
- Use the prompt's timezone and window. Follow the typed route of the
  narrowest companion skill.

## Auth/Setup Guard

Do not run a command that waits for user input, such as setup, login, install, upgrade, or upkeep. Give clear instructions and ask the user to run it.

## Errors in Sandboxes

For sandboxed `twg bb pipeline get`, `wait`, `grep`, or `tail`, follow `references/OUTPUT.md`.
Log restrictions are not evidence of auth failure.

## On gathering evidence

1. Give the first call all known references.
2. Check current claims against live fields. Date past evidence; report unknown facts.
3. Stop at the first policy denial, or when the same error repeats.
4. Treat a named project or service as exact. Keep its qualifiers and check that you found it. Use a renamed or successor item only if a source says so. If you find no evidence, say so.

## Batch Reads

When a command accepts many inputs, send about twenty IDs per call with
`--agent-fields @compact`. Use query or tree metadata when it is enough.
Tell the user what you omitted. After five repeated calls, check for a batch call.

For page edits, load `../twg-confluence/SKILL.md` and follow its body-format and edit rules.

## Assorted Discovery guidelines

- Use `twg trello search "<query>"` for Trello. It has no workspace scope.
- Run `twg rovo list-apps -o json` only when availability is unknown. Reuse auth.
  Do not auto-login or fabricate "none found".
- `docs query` and `work query` return user activity, not title or content matches.
  For topic text, use `docs search` or `work search`. See `references/ROUTING.md`.
- Pass supported original references to native reads. Avoid separate resolve calls.
  Person handoffs: `references/USER-IDENTIFIERS.md`.
- Command shape guardrails:
  - `work query` uses `--scope me|user`, never `--scope global`.
  - Inferred teams need explicit `--include-inferred`; see `references/inferred-teams.md`.
- Use `search-code` with the explicit repo and host. If the request has no anchor, omit `--app` for available indexed SCM.
  Report gaps in the index.
- Use `assets graph` to traverse object, owner, team, or Jira relationships. See `references/ASSETS_GRAPH.md`.
  Otherwise use `assets search`, `assets query --aql`, or `assets object get`.

## Rules

- Never guess IDs, flags, slugs, ARIs, or write contracts.
- For a write, load the product skill, follow live help, and read the current state.
  Tell the user what the write will change, unless they asked you to run it.
- Do not inspect local files, caches, or schemas, unless the user asks about local state.
